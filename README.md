Overpowered Inventory is by Sam Bassett (@lothrazar).  Contains some code from InfiniteInvo by Funwayguy (https://github.com/Funwayguy/InfiniteInvo), I forked that mod initially to learn how to build an inventory and a few things, upgraded minecraft versions, etc.  For screenshots, details, and releases, see the post at
